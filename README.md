# Enumerating Hosts using Wireshark, Windows, and Linux Commands

In this lab project, I will perform enumeration of systems using various command line and GUI tools available in both Linux and Windows environments. I will use command line tools such as db_nmap, net, nbtstat, and ifconfig to gather system and network information. Additionally, I will use GUI-based tools such as Wireshark and Armitage to visually explore and analyze network activity and potential vulnerabilities.

I will explore two primary types of scanning techniques:

Active Scanning: A method that interacts with systems and is detectable on the network.
Passive Scanning: A method that monitors network traffic without actively engaging with hosts, making it undetectable.

The tools and techniques used in this lab will help develop skills in identifying and profiling systems on a network, which are crucial for penetration testing and network defense. Lab practice apart of Infosec Learning and through Springboard Curriculum.
